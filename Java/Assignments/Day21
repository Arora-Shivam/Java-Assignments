What is normalization and why it is needed?

Normalization is organizing the data in most efficient way in RDBMS. We need normalization so that we did not encounter any anomaly.

Explain the 3NF with an example.

Table is said to be in 3NF if-
  *Table is in 2NF
  *There is no transitive dependency between non-prime attribute on any super Key.
  
  Example-
  
  EmpId|EmpName|EmpZip|EmpState|EmpCity
    1  |Name1 | 123456| UP     |Rampur
    2  |Name2 | 235672| MP     |Bhopal
    3  |Name3 | 456831| UP     |Moradabad
    4  |Name4 | 456721| AP     |Telangana
    5  |Name1 | 123456| UP     |Rampur
    
    SuperKeys-{EmpId},{EmpId,EmpName},{EmpId,EmpZip},{EmpId,EmpZip,EmpState}....so on
    
    Candidate Key-{EmpId}
    
    Prime Attributes-EmpId
    Non-Prime Attributes-EmpName,EmpZip,EmpState,EmpCity
    
    Here,EmpZip-->EmpCity and EmpId-->EmpZip
    So we can conclude,EmpId-->EmpState(Transitive Dependency of Non-Prime Attribute on Super Key)
    So,This violates our above condition and the table here is not in 3NF.
